\title{Using OpenFOAM for CFD simulations of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer}
\author{Thijs Van den Brande}
\maketitle

\section{Configuration of your Ubuntu12.04 machine}
Some explenation on installing OpenFOAM and PyFoam on your machine and on using
emacs for text editing.

\section{Introduction to OpenFOAM}
Some information on OpenFOAM

\section{General work flow}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Make mesh in GAMBIT, make sure that no two boundary planes have the same
  name if they don't have the same boundary condition or are an interface. This
  will result in troubles when merging meshes and stitching the interfaces.
  \item Convert the GAMBIT mesh to an OpenFOAM mesh:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item read approach domain in an OpenFOAM case called 'master'
    \item read model in an OpenFOAM case called 'slave'
    \item merge meshes using the mergeMesh command
    \item adjust the initial conditions in the 0 folder
    \item stichMeshes
  \end{itemize}
  \item Have fun doing ABL simulations
\end{enumerate}
